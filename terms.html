              The gold bought by Jewel Aurais refined and sold back to the domestic market as 24kt gold, that is used to make fine gold jewellery. This helps the Srilankan gold market not to overly depend on eternal gold imports. Another portion is sold as gold jewellery in our outlets without the price of workmanship.
